# Intropduction
- In this project I would use the integration of **SQL** using **MySQL** DBMS with **Tableau**, which is most known for its wide range of data visualization capabilities, to delve into a comprehensive database that captures essential employee information such as their department, salaries, hire dates, and their management career.

1. First, with a gender-based analysis since 1990, I compare the distribution of male and female employees. 

2. Subsequently, I explore the evolution of male and female managers, particularly highlighting active managers who become managers in a short time.

3. Then, I focused on the analysis of the average annual salaries across departments, shedding light on gender-based disparities. 

4. Finally, I focused on showing the average salary of male and female employees in each separate department.

You can see all SQL queries for the project here: project_sql folder: [sql_queries](/sql_queries/)


# Tools I Used:
To thoroughly explore critical insights into the employees' database, I utilized the capabilities of a range of essential tools:
1. **SQL:** allowing me to query the database and explore critical insights.
2. **MySQL:** database management system (DBMS).
3. **Visual Studio Code:** for database management and executing SQL queries.
4. **Tableau:** to create charts of the critical insights that are explored from the analysis, because of its wide range of data visualization capabilities, and you can see the whole dashboard on the Tableau public link [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ExploringEmployeeDataInsightsIntegratingSQLwithTableauforComprehensiveAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en%20US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
5. **Git & GitHub:** for sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.
